/**
 * "Audio Optimizer" - a speech-tailored two-band tone shaper plus a gentle loudness leveler and
 * clip guard. Started as a port of eloquence-revived's AudioOptimizer, re-tuned for EloQuick's
 * Klatt/formant output.
 *
 * Presence band: a real bandpass (highpass then lowpass in series), not an open-ended highpass
 * shelf. A synthetic voice's own consonant clarity sits roughly 2.5-5kHz; rolling the excited
 * band off above PRESENCE_HIGH_HZ keeps the boost aimed at clarity instead of also exciting
 * the 5-8kHz sibilance region (s/sh/ch/t).
 *
 * Warmth band: a one-pole lowpass around typical vocal fundamental/first-harmonic territory,
 * for body rather than clarity.
 *
 * Leveler: a gentle, upward-only gain rider (0.85x-1.4x) that nudges quiet passages of an
 * utterance up toward a comfortable level - prosody makes some syllables quieter than others,
 * and evening that out adds fullness on the dynamics axis, not just the spectral one.
 *
 * Clip guard: a same-sample-snap/eased-release limiter just under full scale, a safety net for
 * the two boosts above stacking on an already-loud passage, not a loudness target.
 *
 * Stateful (each filter tracks its previous sample) - construct one instance per synthesis
 * request, not a shared/reused one: reusing an instance across utterances would carry stale
 * filter state (and a stale limiter/leveler gain) into the next one.
